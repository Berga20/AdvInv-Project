# Advanced Investments - Project

Welcome to the Advanced Investment (Strategy Evaluation) repository, dedicated to assessing the worthiness of various investment strategies. In this repository, we explore the nuances of investment strategies, considering diversification benefits and idiosyncratic risk while seeking exploitable anomalies in the risk-return relationship.

Theoretical foundations such as Modern Portfolio Theory guide our exploration, but we also acknowledge the potential for innovative strategies to emerge. Whether it's constructing predefined strategies or devising new ones, this repository serves as a hub for strategy evaluation and refinement.

Files Included:
- **Coding.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing all necessary code to conduct strategy evaluation. From importing and preprocessing stock data to forming portfolios based on sorting and deciles/quintiles, this notebook provides a comprehensive framework for strategy assessment. Additionally, it facilitates alpha and returns evaluation through regression analysis.
